The aim of this research is to develop a method for discovering interests of company’s followers on Twitter and for figuring out their community. However, many users do not publish regularly tweets and due to their limited length, they are difficult to process. Therefore, a new strategy is reported for discovering the points of interest of each follower. Instead of analyzing tweets, this research propose to analyze the links between a company’s follower and the other users they follow. Based on a Latent Semantic Indexing method, this research shows that the followers of a company have similar specific interests. Knowing this, the company can prospect new users to analyze if their interests match those of its followers’ community.
